# 🧠 Swin Transformer Using PyTorch  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project presents a **from-scratch implementation** of the Swin Transformer using **PyTorch**.  
The Swin Transformer is a hierarchical vision transformer that introduces **shifted window-based attention**, significantly improving computational efficiency while maintaining high performance for vision tasks like classification and segmentation.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
✔️ Build modular components for Swin Transformer: patch embedding, attention, MLP, etc.  
✔️ Implement **window-based multi-head self-attention** with positional bias  
✔️ Integrate **shifted windows** for enhanced cross-window connections  
✔️ Hierarchically process input images with **patch merging**  
✔️ Test model with dummy data and analyze the output shape  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Python** 🐍 | Core programming language |
| **PyTorch** 🔥 | Deep learning framework |
| **timm** 🧱 | Model utility layers (DropPath, trunc_normal) |
| **Matplotlib** 📊 | (Optional) For future visualizations |
| **Jupyter Notebook** 📓 | Interactive development and testing |

## 🧱 Swin Transformer Architecture  
- 🧩 **Patch Embedding** – Converts image into non-overlapping patches  
- 👀 **Window Attention** – Performs self-attention in local windows  
- 🔄 **Shifted Windows** – Enables interaction across neighboring windows  
- 🧮 **MLP Block** – Fully connected layers with activation and dropout  
- 🔻 **Patch Merging** – Reduces spatial resolution and increases channel depth  
- 🧱 **Basic Layers** – Multiple Swin blocks stacked hierarchically  
- 🎯 **Final Backbone** – Output ready for downstream tasks

## 🚀 How to Run the Project  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rushikeshraghatate90/swin-transformer-pytorch.git
cd swin-transformer-pytorch
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Launch the Notebook  
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 🧪 Model Testing  
The notebook tests the model on dummy input to verify correctness:  
```python
model = SwinTransformer()
x = torch.randn(32, 3, 224, 224)  # Batch of 32 images
out = model(x)
print(out.shape)  # Expected output: (32, 49, 768)
```
